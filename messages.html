                            <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Introduction
</strong><br>- The Glory of God is as light - Luke 2:9.
<br>- You carrying His glory means you're shining your light - Matthew 5:14-16. 
<br>
<br>- As light, when you appear darkness must disappear - 2 Kings 2:19-22.
<br>- As light, sickness disappears when you appear - Acts 9:32-35, 9:36-42.
<br>- As light, Barrenness must disappear - 2 Kings 4:8-17.
<br>- It is important to know that if you are a carrier of God's glory, the Glory is for God and not you. (He will never share His glory with anyone).
<br>
<br>- As a carrier of God's glory, you will benefit - Matthew 21:1-9.
<br>- Conclusively; once you start carrying His glory, do not stop.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Prayer Point:
</em></strong><br>- Father, let me be a carrier of your glory for the rest of my life.<br>

<br>(1 Samuel 9: 27)
<br><br>Saul's elevation as King of Israel happened when Prophet Samuel showed him God's word. The showing of God’s word was the manifestation of the kingship God ordained for Saul. Saul’s contact with God’s word led to his Exceeding Expansion; Saul was shown God’s word, and then he was shown as king to his generation.
<br>
<br>If God can show you His word, then He will show you to your generation. Your Exceeding Expansion is tied on God’s word. God’s word is the foundation for receiving more than you ask for. God’s word is the bedrock of whatever you will achieve this year. God’s word will attract your portion. God’s word is your comparative advantage. God’s word is the strategy for a year of Exceeding Expansion.
<br>
<br>God’s word made arrangements for Saul’s elevation. As you hear, read, meditate on, and confess God’s word, it will raise you and set you on a high mountain, and open multiple doors for you; God’s word will make the impossible to become possible; God’s word will make your destiny impregnable and unconquerable; God’s word is the ladder you will climb to go higher.
<br>
<br>Live in line with God’s word this year 2021. Dare to obey God’s word in all you do. Keep speaking the Word; keep living by the Word. Let the Word be on your lips always.
<br>
<br>Saul didn't contest for the position of King of Israel, but God’s word brought it to him. God’s word will bring you things you may not be able to fight for. Others may go for it, but God’s word will bring it to you. Cling to God’s word and it will bring you Exceeding Expansion.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Pray:</em></strong> Lord, I choose to cling to Your word; may it bring me Exceeding Expansion, in Jesus’ name!
<br>God bless you.&nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>
<br>“...Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.”
<br>(1 Samuel 9: 27)
<br>
<br>
<br> Samuel instructed Saul to tell his servant to pass on ahead of them. Servants moved behind their masters in Old Testament times; but by Samuel’s instruction, the servant was meant to overtake both Saul and Samuel. Samuel’s instruction created an awkward scenario where a servant was ahead of his master.
<br>
<br>Saul’s servant passed on ahead of them because Samuel wanted to show God's Word to Saul. When a less qualified servant moved ahead of Saul, it was because something greater was about to be unveiled in Saul’s life. Saul’s servant overtook him so that God could unveil Saul’s kingship.
<br>
<br>When the ‘servants’ of this world move ahead of you in life, always remember that there is something new that God wants to show you. When people who are not as qualified as you begin to move ahead of you, don’t despair, there is something new in your life that God is about to unveil. When it seems that your subordinates are fast becoming your superiors, don’t lose your confidence; God is at work in you.
<br>
<br>They overtook you so that your next level of greatness can be made manifest. They overtook you so that God will show you to your generation. They overtook you so that you can step into a new, higher level; they overtook you so that something special and supernatural can be made manifest in you. They overtook you so that you can step into your season of Exceeding Expansion.
<br>
<br>Don’t lose sleep on account of the servants who are currently ahead of you. If God be for you, there will be a showing that the servants won’t be part of.
<br>
<br><strong>Pray: </strong>Lord, when servants overtake me, show me a new thing, in Jesus’ name!
<br>God bless you.dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloribus, odit?

                                            DELAYED ON PURPOSE</strong><br><br>“...Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.”
<br>(1 Samuel 9: 27)
<br>
<br>Samuel commanded Saul to stand still for a while, in order to show him God's word. Saul was going to stay in the same position for a while, because God had something new to show him. He was about to be delayed in one position, because something new was about to be shown to him. He was delayed because there was about to be a showing.
<br>
<br>When God allows you to remain at the same spot longer than you planned, it is for a purpose; just open your eyes, there might be something new that God wants you to see. When you are stuck at the same point you ought to have passed over, not for any fault of yours, be sure that God wants you to see what you haven’t seen.
<br>
<br>God may have allowed your financial status to remain the same for a while so that He can show you new ideas that will increase you. God may have allowed you to be stuck with some problems so that you can pray more or even appreciate His mercies more. God may have allowed you to remain longer than you wish on the same level because of lessons you are yet to learn. If God allows delay, He has a purpose you need to discover.
<br>
<br>When no purpose is being achieved through the delays you are facing, you just might be dealing with a case of stagnation. When you are delayed and God does not show you anything new, open your eyes to see.
<br>
<br>Samuel wanted Saul to stand still for a while. What looked like delay in Saul's life was only for a while. Any God-ordained delay in your life is for a while. Soon, you will step out of it and step into your next level.
<br>
<br><strong>Pray:</strong> Lord, for every delay I face in destiny, show me a new thing; my delay is for a while, in Jesus’ name!
<br>God bless you.<br><strong>
